(The foliage used for the rendered images is not my own but from Quixel. I have removed the foliage from the final blender file as this was part of the memory issues I had.)

I have encountered rendering and memory issues and couldn't upload on time. After many trials and dropbox expiring I have decided to upload my coursework file (3 rendered pictures, a Blender file with packed textures and the pre-production documentation) separately.  

The images are on this Github repo and the Blender file is on my Google Drive (the above link).  

I'm so sorry for this confusing situation.
